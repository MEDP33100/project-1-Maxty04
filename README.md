# MEDP 33100 Project 1: Interactive Storytelling

## Project Overview

- To briefly tell the story of apollo 13.
- while Bowie's "space oddity" plays in the background we go through the story of what could have also happened in real life to the crew of the apollo mission. however, due to something as a watch, their journey was saved and instead became a historic moment. 
## Figma Design

- https://www.figma.com/design/fh8QV1pWBsN7sLdXjDjNyK/P1?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=OxzdXm1iAi7t3aUv-0
- originally it was going to be a scrolling page that took you through each moment of the story, however i could not get it to function in the same way i envisioned it. instead to add interactivity, i turned it into a slideshow like view. 

## Features

- List the key features of the project, including:
    - **Animations**: floating images to simulate zero gravity of space. 
    - **Sound Effects**: the click of the slide show similar to an old projector. the song playing in the background to parallel real life events. 
    - **User-triggered Events**: click controls to let the user move at own pace. 

## Technologies Used

- List the technologies and tools used in the project:
    - **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - **Libraries**: (e.g., GSAP for animations)
    - **Other**: GitHub Pages for hosting, Figma for design
