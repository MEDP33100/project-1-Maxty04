            "Other than the obvious, there was one other major issue. All of the main computers were down. This meant the astronauts had to calculate everything by hand on how to re-enter the atmosphere.",
            "The crew calculated they needed to activate engines for exactly 14 seconds for proper re-entry into Earthâ€™s orbit and atmosphere. If missed by one second in either direction, they would either crash-land, or miss Earth entirely and likely die in space.",
            "With limited to no communication with Houston, this meant that their survival entirely depended on a tool issued by NASA. A watch known as the Omega Speedmaster that had made it back with the crew in one piece.",
            "Because of the importance of the moment in history, NASA awarded the rare 'Silver Snoopy' award to the company for providing the necessary tools to save the mission at hand.",
            "The crew was able to land safely and return home to their families. The watch now resides in the 'Air and Space' museum at the Smithsonian in Washington D.C., next to the shuttle and other important pieces from other historic missions."
